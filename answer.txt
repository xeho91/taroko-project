To my understanding, solution two (option 2).
It avoids unnecessary binding.

Assuming the array list will have 1000 items, then the JavaScript engine will
take the time to find the specific child node to make any event listener
operation it.

To sum up, it will take a significant performance toll because it
will have to loop all of the childNodes, to get/find specific element
properties.
